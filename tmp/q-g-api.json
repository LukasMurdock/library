This is a must-read for executives and partners in small to large firms. Ron provides the basics, the advanced ideas, the workbooks, the case studies—everything. This is a must-have and a terrific book.\" —Reed K. Holden founder and CEO, Holden Advisors, Corp., Associate Professor, Columbia University www.holdenadvisors.com \"We've known through Ron Baker's earlier books that he's not just an extraordinary thinker and truly brilliant writer—he's a mover and a shaker on a mission. This is the End of Time! Brilliant.\" —Paul Dunn Chairman, B1G1® www.b1g1.com \"Implementing Value Pricing is a powerful blend of theory, strategy, and tactics. Ron Baker's most recent offering is ambitious in scope, exploring topics that include economic theory, customer orientation, value identification, service positioning, and pricing strategy. He weaves all of them together seamlessly, and includes numerous examples to illustrate his primary points. I have applied the knowledge I've gained from his body of work, and the benefits to me—and to my customers—have been immediate, significant, and ongoing.\" —Brent Uren Principal, Valuation & Business Modeling Ernst & Young® www.ey.com \"Ron Baker is a revolutionary. He is on a radical crusade to align the interests of service providers with those of their customers by having lawyers, accountants, and consultants charge based on the value they provide, rather than the effort it takes. Implementing Value Pricing is a manifesto that establishes a clear case for the revolution. It provides detailed guidance that includes not only strategies and tactics, but key predictive indicators for success. It is richly illustrated by the successes of firms that have embraced value-based pricing to make their services not only more cost-effective for their customers, but more profitable as well. The hallmark of a manifesto is an unyielding sense of purpose and a call to action. Let the revolution begin.\" —Robert G. Cross, Chairman and CEO, Revenue Analytics, Inc.

A must-read for all those who are managing multinational business teams in a complex and highly competitive environment.\" —Samik Mukherjee, Vice President, Onshore Business, Technip \"Customers need to know the value they will receive and how they will receive it. Thull's insights into the complex sale and how to clarify and quantify this value are remarkable—Mastering the Complex Sale will be required reading for years to come!\" —Lee Tschanz, Vice President, North American Sales, Rockwell Automation \"Jeff Thull is winning the war against commoditization. In his world, value trumps price and commoditization isn't a given, it's a choice. This is a proven alternative to the price-driven sale. We've spoken to his clients. This stuff really works, folks.\" —Dave Stein, CEO and Founder, ES Research Group, Inc. \"Our business depends on delivering breakthrough thinking to our executive clients. Jeff Thull has significantly redefined sales and marketing strategies that clearly connect to our global audience. Read it, act on it, and take your results to exceptional levels.\" —Sven Kroneberg, President, Seminarium Internacional \"Jeff's main thesis—that professional customer guidance is the key to success—rings true in every global market today. Mastering the Complex Sale is the essential read for any organization looking to transform their business for long-term, value-driven growth.\" —Jon T. Lindekugel, President, 3M Health Information Systems, Inc. \"Jeff Thull has re-engineered the conventional sales process to create predictable and profitable growth in today's competitive marketplace. It's no longer about selling; it's about guiding quality decisions and creating collaborative value.

Brand by Hand documents the work, career, and artistic inspiration of graphic designer extraordinaire Jon Contino. A born-and-bred New Yorker, Jon’s upbringing comes through in the way he talks—and, most importantly, in the way he designs. He is the founder and creative director of Jon Contino Studio, and for more than two decades, he has built a massive collection of award-winning graphic-design work for high-profile clients such as Nike, 20th Century Fox, and Sports Illustrated. Over the course of his career, Jon has gone to design hell and back, facing obstacles like fear, self-doubt, and bad luck. Brand by Hand documents the evolution of his work, exploring his lifelong devotion to the guts and grime of New York and cementing his biggest artistic inspirations, from hardcore music to America’s favorite pastime. Brand by Hand showcases Jon’s minimalist illustrations and unmistakable hand-lettering. It also shares how he took a passion for pen and ink and turned it into an expanding empire of clients, merchandise, and artwork.",
