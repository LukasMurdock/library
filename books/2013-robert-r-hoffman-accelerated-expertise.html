    <summary>Summary</summary>
    <p>This book deals with current issues of training:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How to quicken the training process while maintaining its effectiveness (Rapidized Training),</li>
    <li>How to train more quickly to higher levels of proficiency (Accelerated Proficiency),</li>
    <li>How to conduct cognitive task analysis more efficiently to feed into training (Rapidized Cognitive Task Analysis),</li>
    <li>How to rapidize the sharing of lessons learned from the battlespace into the training context (Rapidized Transposition), and</li>
    <li>How to ensure that training has a stable and lasting effect (Facilitated Retention).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Research findings</strong></p>
    <p>One must be cautious in generalizing the effects of the numerous interacting variables that affect training. &ldquo;Training for complex tasks is itself a complex task and most principles for good instruction are contextual, not universal&rdquo; (Reigeluth, personal communication). Some general findings are:</p>
    <p><strong>Training</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Training is generally more effective if the initial learning is about domain concepts and principles and not just specific details of tasks and procedures.</li>
    <li>Training at advanced levels (training to perform in dynamic and complex domains where tasks are not fixed) is generally more effective if it involves extensive practice on realistic examples or scenarios (problem-based learning).</li>
    <li>Training has to balance giving and withholding of outcome and process feedback to achieve optimal learning at different stages of advancement.</li>
    <li>Training at intermediate and advanced levels benefits significantly from experience at challenge problems or cases; the &ldquo;desirable difficulties.&rdquo; Short-term performance might suffer, but longer-term gains will emerge.</li>
    <li>Mentoring is valuable and critical for advanced learning, because it provides opportunities to receive rich process and outcome feedback as learners encounter increasingly complex problems. However, mentoring is not always necessary in advanced stages of learning.</li>
    <li>Training using intelligent tutoring systems and serious games (virtual reality systems) can be highly effective.</li>
    <li>Training that is based on a dynamic, context-sensitive, and situation-specific model derived from cognitive task analyses of expert performers is more effective than legacy training programs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Transfer</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Initial learning that is more difficult can lead to greater flexibility and transfer; when learners are initially exposed to simplifications of complex topics, serious misunderstandings can remain entrenched and interfere with or preclude deeper, more accurate understandings.</li>
    <li>Transferring a skill to new situations is often difficult but can be promoted by following a number of training principles: employing deliberate practice, increasing the variability of practice, adding sources of contextual interference, using a mixed practice schedule, distributing practice in time, and providing process and outcome feedback in an explicit analysis of errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Retention and Decay</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Significant decay can occur even within relatively short time frames (days to weeks) for any form of skill or learned material. Although there can be differential decay of memory versus skill, decay is generally greatest shortly after a hiatus period begins, and levels out thereafter. For example, pilots know that most skill loss occurs within the first year, and then skill decay slows marginally after that.</li>
    <li>The best predictor of skill retention at the end of a hiatus is the level of performance achieved (including overlearning) just prior to the hiatus. The greater the degree of overlearning, the more that the decay curve gets &ldquo;stretched out.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>Performance that requires appreciable coordination between cognitive skills and motor skills is most substantially degraded (again, using piloting as an example, instrument flying skills deteriorate more than basic flying skills).</li>
    <li>Periodic practice during periods of hiatus should commence not long after the hiatus begins. Periodic practice can promote retention over long intervals.</li>
    <li>Retention during hiatus is better if the same practice task is not repeated, but is interspersed with other job-related tasks within practice sessions.</li>
    <li>The variable having the greatest impact on performance after a retention interval is the similarity of the conditions of the training (acquisition) and work (retention) environments. To promote retention, there should be substantive and functional similarity of the job tasks and job environment with the retention tasks and task environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Teams</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Individuals who are more proficient at solving problems related to the team&rsquo;s primary goals (team task work) place a high value on cooperation and engage in more work-related communication (teamwork). Thus, training in the achievement and maintenance of common ground will enhance team performance.</li>
    <li>In high-performing teams, team members develop rich mental models of the goals of the other team members. Training that promotes cross-role understanding facilitates the achievement of high proficiency in teams.</li>
    <li>High-performing teams effectively exchange information in a consensually agreed- upon manner and with consistent and meaningful terminology, and are careful to clarify or acknowledge the receipt of information. Training that promotes such communication facilitates the achievement of high proficiency in teams.</li>
    <li>Experienced teams efficiently exchange information, and may actually communicate overtly less than teams that are not high performing.</li>
    <li>Experience while team membership changes can facilitate the acquisition of teamwork skills.</li>
    <li>The question of performance decay in teamwork skills due to hiatus is an open subject for research.</li>
    <li>Training for accelerated team proficiency, like training for individuals, benefits from problem or scenario-based practice using realistic and complex scenarios (e.g., serious games, simulated distributed mission operations).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>None of the above generalizations holds uniformly; for all of the above, one can find studies showing opposite effects, or no effects. For example, while it makes sense to maintain consistency of team membership, the mixing of teams can allow team members to gain skill at adapting, and skill at the rapid forging of high-functioning teams. In addition, in many work contexts (including the military), membership can be necessarily ad hoc, there is a mixture of proficiency levels, and team membership typically changes frequently.</p>

        <caption><strong>Table 10.1</strong> Paradoxes and ironies of careers that complicate the development of high proficiency</caption>
        <tr><td><em>The policy-proficiency paradox.</em> In some domains (e.g., intelligence analysis, cultural understanding) broad knowledge is a requirement. Promotion to leadership positions depends on having had experience in diverse jobs/roles. But this policy limits the opportunity for individuals to achieve high levels of proficiency in any one job/role.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>The culture-measurement clash.</em> In some domains, performance has to be continually evaluated even after the achievement of ceiling-level performance according to some criterion. Research has shown that experts continue to get better even after they “always get it right” on some criterion measure of performance. Furthermore, once a fighter pilot, for instance, has achieved very good performance as evaluated at some stage of training or operational performance, they will maintain that level, on the record, because if they do not they will not advance in their military career. This sets up a possible goal conflict, where in some domains or organizations there might actually be incentives against measuring (and thereby understanding) proficiency and its development.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>The myth of the career path.</em> Careers are not set on a specific path in the sense of tracking a standardized progression plan. “While there is a written path, it is rarely followed.” Careers are managed within sets of changing constraints, especially “bellybutton shortages.” In some specialties (e.g., piloting) there is a sophisticated process for managing careers. In most specialties, there is not. “You can select your preferences for future assignments, but your commander also makes recommendations and then the personnel office decides, depending on needs, billets available, etc.” In some careers, time away from the specialty is not tracked so you do not know when to add reintegration training.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>The irony of transitioning.</em> Promotion hinges on broad experience that helps develop competency at jobs/ roles that fall at supervisory levels. But assignments (in the military) will transition individuals across levels. Just-in-time training courses are out there, but are not designed for people transitioning across levels. Training is necessary prior to any reassignment, and while the courses (typically two months long) can be good for exposure, they do not promote deep comprehension. There is not enough time available. There is no tracking of people who can help in training. It can be awkward to ask for help from subordinates.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>The ironies of demotivation.</em> Demotivation manifests itself in a number of forms and for a variety of reasons. Deployment itself contributes to the acceleration of proficiency, but the basic job responsibilities can consume one’s time and energy. There is significant burnout potential for doing extra learning and training. Broadening negatively impacts career progression and triggers thoughts of getting out. “You repeatedly experience a loss of confidence.”</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>The ironies of reassignment.</em> Reassigning individuals just as they achieve high proficiency cuts against the notion that organizational capability is built upon individual expertise. Reassignment may be necessary for staffing, and is necessary for training individuals who are selected to move to higher levels of work. But it can be recognized that reassignment is at least partly responsible for creating the problem of skill decay in the first place. There are significant secondary effects that also should be considered. For example, upon return to a primary assignment, the post-hiatus refresher training might involve work on routine cases. This may lead to overconfidence in the earliest stage of a redeployment, and might limit the worker’s ability to cope with novel or challenging situations.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>The ironies of under-utilization of resources.</em> While some organizations recognize the need to collect and share “lessons learned,” such lessons are often archived in ways that make meaningful search difficult, and hence become “lessons forgotten.” Debriefing records are a significantly under-utilized resource for training, and could provide a library of cases, lessons learned, and scenarios for use in formative training.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><em>The irony of the consequences of limiting the resources.</em> In past years, re-training following hiatus could be brief (six weeks) (we might say “accelerated”) because pilots had had thousands of hours of flying time prior to their hiatus. But pilots are flying less now, largely due to high cost. This has two repercussions: it mandates more training post-hiatus (which has its own associated costs) and the reduced flight practice hours detract from the goal of accelerating the achievement of proficiency, thus placing the overall organizational capability at risk.</td></tr>
