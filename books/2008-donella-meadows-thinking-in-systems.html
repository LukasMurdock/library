    <h3>System Definitions: A Glossary</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Archetypes:</span> Common system structures that produce
      characteristic patterns of behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Balancing feedback loop:</span> A stabilizing,
      goal-seeking, regulating feedback loop, also know as a &ldquo;negative
      feedback loop&rdquo; because it opposes, or reverses, whatever direction of
      change is imposed on the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Bounded rationality:</span> The logic that leads to
      decisions or actions that make sense within one part of a system but are not
      reasonable within a broader context or when seen as a part of the wider
      system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Dynamic equilibrium:</span> The condition in which the
      state of a stock (its level or its size) is steady and unchanging, despite
      inflows and outflows. This is possible only when all inflows equal all
      outflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Dynamics:</span> The behavior over time of a system or
      any of its components.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Feedback loop:</span> The mechanism (rule or information
      flow or signal) that allows a change in a stock to affect a flow into or out
      of that same stock. A closed chain of causal connections from a stock,
      through a set of decisions and actions dependent on the level of the stock,
      and back again through a flow to change the stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Flow:</span> Material or information that enters or
      leaves a stock over a period of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Hierarchy:</span> Systems organized in such a way as to
      create a larger system. Subsystems within systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Limiting factor:</span> A necessary system input that is
      the one limiting the activity of the system at a particular moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Linear relationship:</span> A relationship between two
      elements in a system that has constant proportion between cause and effect
      and so can be drawn with a straight line on a graph. The effect is additive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Nonlinear relationship:</span> A relationship between two
      elements in a system where the cause does not produce a proportional
      (straight-line) effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Reinforcing feedback loop:</span> An amplifying or
      enhancing feedback loop, also known as a &ldquo;positive feedback
      loop&rdquo; because it reinforces the direction of change. These are vicious
      cycles and virtuous circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Resilience:</span> The ability of a system to recover
      from perturbation; the ability to restore or repair or bounce back after a
      change due to an outside force.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Self-organization:</span> The ability of a system to
      structure itself, to create new structure, to learn, or diversify.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Shifting dominance:</span> The change over time of the
      relative strengths of competing feedback loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Stock:</span> An accumulation of material or information
      that has built up in a system over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">Suboptimization:</span> The behavior resulting from a
      subsystem&rsquo;s goals dominating at the expense of the total
      system&rsquo;s goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="bold">System:</span> A set of elements or parts that is
      coherently organized and interconnected in a pattern or structure that
      produces a characteristic set of behaviors, often classified as its
      &ldquo;function&rdquo; or &ldquo;purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>Summary of Systems Principles</h3>
    <p>Systems</p>
    <blockquote>&bull; A system is more than the sum of its parts.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Many of the interconnections in systems operate through the flow of
      information.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; The least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is
      often the most crucial determinant of the system&rsquo;s behavior.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; System structure is the source of system behavior. System behavior
      reveals itself as a series of events over time.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Stocks, Flows, and Dynamic Equilibrium</p>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the
      system.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; If the sum of inflows exceeds the sum of outflows, the stock level
      will rise.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; If the sum of outflows exceeds the sum of inflows, the stock level
      will fall.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; If the sum of outflows equals the sum of inflows, the stock level
      will not change &mdash; it will be held in dynamic equilibrium.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by
      increasing its inflow rate.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Stocks allow inflows and outflows to be de-coupled and independent.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Feedback Loops</p>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; A feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock,
      through a set of decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are
      dependent on the level of the stock, and back again through a flow to change
      the stock.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Balancing feedback loops are equilibrating or goal-seeking structures
      in systems and are both sources of stability and sources of resistance to
      change.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Reinforcing feedback loops are self-enhancing, leading to exponential
      growth or to runaway collapses over time.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; The information delivered by a feedback loop&mdash;even nonphysical
      feedback&mdash;can affect only future behavior; it can&rsquo;t deliver a
      signal fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; A stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop must have its goal set
      appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect
      that stock. Otherwise, the feedback process will fall short of or exceed the
      target for the stock.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Systems with similar feedback structures produce similar dynamic
      behaviors.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Shifting Dominance, Delays, and Oscillations</p>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Complex behaviors of systems often arise as the relative strengths of
      feedback loops shift, causing first one loop and then another to dominate
      behavior.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; A delay in a balancing feedback loop makes a system likely to
      oscillate.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Changing the length of a delay may make a large change in the
      behavior of a system.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Scenarios and Testing Models</p>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; System dynamics models explore possible futures and ask &ldquo;what
      if&rdquo; questions.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Model utility depends not on whether its driving scenarios are
      realistic (since no one can know that for sure), but on whether it responds
      with a realistic pattern of behavior.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Constraints on Systems</p>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; In physical, exponentially growing systems, there must be at least
      one reinforcing loop driving the growth <span class="italic">and</span> at
      least one balancing loop constraining the growth, because no system can grow
      forever in a finite environment.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>&bull; Nonrenewable resources are stock-limited.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>&bull; Renewable resources are flow-limited.</blockquote>
    <p>Resilience, Self-Organization, and Hierarchy</p>
    <blockquote>&bull; There are always limits to resilience.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Systems need to be managed not only for productivity or stability,
      they also need to be managed for resilience.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Systems often have the property of self-organization&mdash;the
      ability to structure themselves, to create new structure, to learn,
      diversify, and complexify.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom up. The purpose of the
      upper layers of the hierarchy is to serve the purposes of the lower layers.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Source of System Surprises</p>
    <blockquote>&bull; Many relationships in systems are nonlinear.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; There are no separate systems. The world is a continuum. Where to
      draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is
      the one that is most limiting.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Any physical entity with multiple inputs and outputs is surrounded by
      layers of limits.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>&bull; There always will be limits to growth.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; A quantity growing exponentially toward a limit reaches that limit in
      a surprisingly short time.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; When there are long delays in feedback loops, some sort of foresight
      is essential.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; The bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to
      decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mindsets and Models</p>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Everything we think we know about the world is a model.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Our models do have a strong congruence with the world.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      &bull; Our models fall far short of representing the real world fully.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Springing the System Traps</h3>
    <h4>Policy Resistance</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: When various actors try to pull a system
      state toward various goals, the result can be policy resistance. Any new
      policy, especially if it&rsquo;s effective, just pulls the system state
      farther from the goals of other actors and produces additional resistance,
      with a result that no one likes, but that everyone expends considerable
      effort in maintaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: Let go. Bring in all the actors and
      use the energy formerly expended on resistance to seek out mutually
      satisfactory ways for all goals to be realized&mdash;or redefinitions of
      larger and more important goals that everyone can pull toward together.
    </p>
    <h4>The Tragedy of the Commons</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: When there is a commonly shared resource,
      every user benefits directly from its use, but shares the costs of its abuse
      with everyone else. Therefore, there is very weak feedback from the
      condition of the resource to the decisions of the resource users. The
      consequence is overuse of the resource, eroding it until it becomes
      unavailable to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: Educate and exhort the users, so
      they understand the consequences of abusing the resource. And also restore
      or strengthen the missing feedback link, either by privatizing the resource
      so each user feels the direct consequences of its abuse or (since many
      resources cannot be privatized) by regulating the access of all users to the
      resource.
    </p>
    <h4>Drift to Low Performance</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: Allowing performance standards to be
      influenced by past performance, especially if there is a negative bias in
      perceiving past performance, sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding
      goals that sets a system drifting toward low performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: Keep performance standards
      absolute. Even better, let standards be enhanced by the best actual
      performances instead of being discouraged by the worst. Set up a drift
      toward high performance!
    </p>
    <h4>Escalation</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: When the state of one stock is determined
      by trying to surpass the state of another stock&mdash;and vice
      versa&mdash;then there is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system
      into an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign, escalating loudness,
      escalating violence. The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes
      surprisingly quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will be stopped by
      someone&rsquo;s collapse&mdash;because exponential growth cannot go on
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: The best way out of this trap is to
      avoid getting in it. If caught in an escalating system, one can refuse to
      compete (unilaterally disarm), thereby interrupting the reinforcing loop. Or
      one can negotiate a new system with balancing loops to control the
      escalation.
    </p>
    <h4>Success to the Successful</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: If the winners of a competition are
      systematically rewarded with the means to win again, a reinforcing feedback
      loop is created by which, if it is allowed to proceed uninhibited, the
      winners eventually take all, while the losers are eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: Diversification, which allows those
      who are losing the competition to get out of that game and start another
      one; strict limitation on the fraction of the pie any one winner may win
      (antitrust laws); policies that level the playing field, removing some of
      the advantage of the strongest players or increasing the advantage of the
      weakest; policies that devise rewards for success that do not bias the next
      round of competition.
    </p>
    <h4>Shifting the Burden to the Intervenor</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: Shifting the burden, dependence, and
      addiction arise when a solution to a systemic problem reduces (or disguises)
      the symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Whether it
      is a substance that dulls one&rsquo;s perception or a policy that hides the
      underlying trouble, the drug of choice interferes with the actions that
      could solve the real problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the intervention designed to correct the problem causes the
      self-maintaining capacity of the original system to atrophy or erode, then a
      destructive reinforcing feedback loop is set in motion. The system
      deteriorates; more and more of the solution is then required. The system
      will become more and more dependent on the intervention and less and less
      able to maintain its own desired state.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: Again, the best way out of this
      trap is to avoid getting in. Beware of symptom-relieving or signal-denying
      policies or practices that don&rsquo;t really address the problem. Take the
      focus off short-term relief and put it on long term restructuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are the intervenor, work in such a way as to restore or enhance the
      system&rsquo;s own ability to solve its problems, then remove yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are the one with an unsupportable dependency, build your
      system&rsquo;s own capabilities back up before removing the intervention. Do
      it right away. The longer you wait, the harder the withdrawal process will
      be.
    </p>
    <h4>Rule Beating</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: Rules to govern a system can lead to
      rule-beating&mdash;perverse behavior that gives the appearance of obeying
      the rules or achieving the goals, but that actually distorts the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: Design, or redesign, rules to
      release creativity not in the direction of beating the rules, but in the
      direction of achieving the purpose of the rules.
    </p>
    <h4>Seeking the Wrong Goal</h4>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Trap</span>: System behavior is particularly sensitive
      to the goals of feedback loops. If the goals&mdash;the indicators of
      satisfaction of the rules&mdash;are defined inaccurately or incompletely,
      the system may obediently work to produce a result that is not really
      intended or wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="italic">The Way Out</span>: Specify indicators and goals that
      reflect the real welfare of the system. Be especially careful not to confuse
      effort with result or you will end up with a system that is producing
      effort, not result.

    <h3>Model Equations</h3>
    <p>
      There is much to be learned about systems without using a computer. However,
      once you have started to explore the behavior of even very simple systems,
      you may well find that you wish to learn more about building your own formal
      mathematical models of systems. The models in this book were originally
      developed using STELLA modeling software, by isee systems Inc. (formerly
      High Performance Systems). The equations in this section are written to be
      easily translated into various modeling software, such as Vensim by Ventana
      Systems Inc. as well as STELLA and iThink by isee systems Inc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following model equations are those used for the nine dynamic models
      discussed in chapters 1 and 2. &ldquo;Converters&rdquo; can be constants or
      calculations based on other elements of the system model. Time is
      abbreviated (t) and the change in time from one calculation to the next, the
      time interval, is noted as (dt).

    <p>
      You people are different. You ask different kinds of questions. You see
      things I don&rsquo;t see. Somehow you come at the world in a different way.
      How? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      The blind men and the matter of the elephant. The behavior of a system
      cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made.
    </p>
    <p>System definitions: a glossary</p>
    <p>
      System: a set of elements or parts coherently organized and interconnected
      in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of behaviors,
      often classified as it&rsquo;s &ldquo;function&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>Purposes or deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.</p>
    <p>
      An important function of almost every system is to ensure its own
      perpetuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stock can be increased by decreasing its outflow rate as well as by
      increasing its inflow rate. These two strategies may have very different
      costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow. Stocks
      generally change slowly, even when the flows into or out of them change
      suddenly. Therefore, stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the
      mechanisms for regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows.
      Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of &ldquo;feedback
      processes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>If A causes B, is it possible that B also causes A?</p>
    <p>Balancing feedback loops&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Reinforcing feedback loops</p>
    <p>
      Because we bump into reinforcing loops so often, it is handy to know this
      shortcut: the time it takes for an exponentially growing stock to double in
      size, the &ldquo;doubling time&rdquo; equals approximately 70 divided by the
      growth rate (expressed as a percentage).&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: if you put $100 in the bank at 7% interest per year, you will
      double your money in 10 years (70/7=10). If you get only 5% interest, your
      money will take 14 years to double.
    </p>
    <p>
      The information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect future
      behavior; it can&rsquo;t deliver the information, and so it can&rsquo;t have
      an impact fast enough to correct behavior that drove the current feedback. A
      person in the system who makes a decision based on feedback can&rsquo;t
      change the behavior of the system that drove the current feedback; the
      decisions they make will affect only future behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flow can&rsquo;t react instantly to a flow. It can react only to a change
      in a stock, and only after a slight delay to register the incoming
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stock-maintaining balancing feedback loop must have it&rsquo;s goal set
      appropriately to compensate for draining or inflowing processes that affect
      the stock. Otherwise, the feedback processes will fall short of or exceed
      the target for the stock.
    </p>
    <p>Questions for testing the value of a model:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?</li>
      <li>If they did, would the system react this way?</li>
      <li>What is driving the driving factors?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Self-organization produces heterogeneity and unpredictability. It is likely
      to come up with whole new structures, whole new ways of doing things. It
      requires freedom and experimentation, and a certain amount of disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      These conditions that encourage self-organization often can be scary for
      individuals and threatening to power structures. As a consequence, education
      systems may restrict the creative powers of children instead of stimulating
      those powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom up. The purpose of the upper
      layers of the hierarchy is to serve the purposes of the lower layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything we think we know about the world is a model. Our models do have a
      strong congruence with the world. Our models fall far short of representing
      the real world fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The behavior of a system is its performance over time &mdash;its growth,
      stagnation, decline, oscillation, randomness, or evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a systems thinker encounters a problem, the first thing he or she does
      is look for data, time graphs, the history of the system. That&rsquo;s
      because long-term behavior provides clues to the underlying system
      structure. And structure is the
    </p>
    <p>
      key to understanding not just <em>what</em> is happening, but <em>why</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesson of boundaries is hard even for systems thinkers to get. There is
      no single, legitimate boundary to draw around a system. We have to invent
      boundaries for clarity and sanity; and boundaries can produce problems when
      we forget that we&rsquo;ve artificially created them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any given time, the input that is most important to a system is the one
      that is most limiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When there are long delays in feedback loops, some sort of foresight is
      essential. To act only when a problem becomes obvious is to miss an
      important opportunity to solve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes a difference is redesigning the system to improve the
      information, incentives, disincentives, goals, stresses, and constraints
      that have an effect on specific actors.
    </p>
    <p>Problematic system archetypes</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Policy resistance: when actors try to pull a system stick toward various
        goals. Any new policy just pulls the stock farther from the goals of other
        actors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tragedy of the commons: when there is simple growth in a commonly shared,
        erodible environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drift to low performance: standards aren&rsquo;t absolute. When perceived
        performance slips, the goal is allowed to slip. death spirals. Eroding
        goals.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        Escalation: when the state of a stock is determined by trying to surpass
        the state of another stock&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;then there is a
        reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system into an arms race.
      </li>
      <li>
        Success to the successful: winners receive means to compete even more
        effectively. The competitive exclusion principle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Addition&mdash;dependence&mdash;shifting the burden to the intervenor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rule beating: evasive action to get around the intent of a systems rules.
      </li>
      <li>Seeking the wrong goal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The most effective way of dealing with policy resistance is to find a way of
      aligning the various goals of the subsystems, usually by providing an
      overarching goal that allows all actors to break out of their bounded
      rationality.
    </p>
    <p>There are three ways to avoid the tragedy of the commons.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Educate and exhort. Help people to see the consequences of unrestrained
        use of the commons. Appeal to their morality. Persuade them to be
        temperate. Threaten transgressions with social disapproval or eternal
        hellfire.
      </li>
      <li>
        Privatize the commons. Divide it up so that each person reaps the
        consequences of his or her own actions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Regulate the commons. Mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon. To be
        effective, regulation must be enforced by policing and penalties. Market
        competition systemically eliminates market competition.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are two antidotes to eroding goals. One is to keep standards absolute,
      regardless of performance. Another is to make goals sensitive to the best
      performances of the past, instead of the worst. Set up a drift toward high
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way of out escalation is to avoid getting in it. Refuse to compete.
      Or negotiate a new system with balancing loops to control the escalation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success-to-success feedback loop can be kept under control by putting
      into place feedback loops that keep any competitor from taking over
      entirely. &ldquo;Leveling the playing field&rdquo; get out of the game and
      start a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shifting the burden to the intervenor, the best way out is to avoid getting
      in this trap. Beware of symptom-relieving or signal-denying policies or
      practices that don&rsquo;t really address the problem. Take the focus off
      short-term relief and put it on long-term restructuring. Begin with a series
      of questions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why are the natural correction mechanisms failing?</li>
      <li>How can obstacles to their success be removed?</li>
      <li>How can mechanisms for their success be made more effective?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The way out of rule beating: Understand rule bearing as useful feedback, and
      revise, improve, rescind, or better explain the rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way out to avoid seeking the wrong goal: specify indicators and goals
      that reflect the real welfare of the system. Be careful not to confuse
      effort with result or you will end up with a system that is producing
      effort, not result.

      >
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Numbers&mdash;constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, and
        standards. Adjustments to faucets. Probably 99 percent of our attention
        goes to parameters, but there&rsquo;s not a lot of leverage in them. If
        the system is stagnant, parameter changes rarely kick-start it. If
        it&rsquo;s wildly variable, they usually don&rsquo;t stabilize it. If
        it&rsquo;s growing out of control, they don&rsquo;t slow it down.
        Parameters become leverage points when they go into ranges that kick off
        another item in this list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buffers&mdash;The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows. You
        can often stabilize a system by increasing the capacity of a buffer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stock-and-flow systems&mdash;Physical systems and their nodes of
        intersection. The only way to fix a system that is laid out poorly is to
        rebuild it, if you can. The leverage point is in proper design in the
        first place. After the structure is built, the leverage is in
        understanding its limitations and bottlenecks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Delays&mdash;The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes.
        Delay length is a high leverage point, except delays are not often easily
        changeable. It&rsquo;s usually easier to slow down the change rate, so
        that inevitable feedback delays won&rsquo;t cause so much trouble.
      </li>
      <li>
        Balancing feedback loops&mdash;The strength of the feedbacks relative to
        the impacts they are trying to correct.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        Reinforcing feedback loops&mdash;The strength of the gain of driving
        loops. Reducing the gain around a reinforcing loop&mdash;slowing the
        growth&mdash;is usually a more powerful leverage point in systems than
        strength if the balancing loops, and far more preferable than letting the
        reinforcing loop run. Look for leverage points around &ldquo;success to
        the successful&rdquo; loops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Information flows&mdash;The structure of who does and does not have access
        to information. A new loop delivering feedback to a place where it
        wasn&rsquo;t going before. Missing information is one of the most common
        causes of system malfunction. Adding or restoring information can be a
        powerful intervention.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rules&mdash;Incentives, punishments, constraints. Power over the rules is
        real power.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        Self-organization&mdash;The power to add, change, or evolve system
        structure. Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system high on
        this list. The ability to self/organize is the strongest form of
        resilience. Self-organization is basically a highly variable stock of
        information from which to select possible patterns, and a means for
        experimentation, for selecting and testing new patterns. The intervention
        point here is encouraging variability and experimentation and
        diversity&mdash;losing control.
      </li>
      <li>
        Goals&mdash;The purpose or function of the system. Everything above in the
        list gets twisted to conform to a goal. There is high leverage in
        articulating, meaning, repeating, standing up for, insisting upon, new
        system goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paradigms&mdash;The mind-set out of which the system&mdash;its goals,
        structure, rules, delays, parameters&mdash;arises. Paradigms are the
        sources of everything about systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transcending paradigms. If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever
        one will help to achieve your purpose.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s one thing to understand how to fix a system and quite another to
      wade in and fix it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of making a complex system do just what you want it to do can be
      achieve only temporarily, at best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems can&rsquo;t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned.
      We can&rsquo;t surge forward with certainty into a world full of no
      surprises, but we can expect surprises and learn from them and even profit
      from them. We can&rsquo;t impose our will on a system. We can listen to what
      the system tell us, and discover how it&rsquo;s properties and our values
      can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be
      produced by our will alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can&rsquo;t control systems or figure them out, but we can dance with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>Learning to dance with systems.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Get the Beat of the System. Before you disturb the system in any way, what
        how it behaves. Learn it&rsquo;s history. Ask people who&rsquo;ve been
        around for a long time to tell you what has happened. Find it make a time
        graph of actual data from the system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Expose your mental models to the light of day. Make them as rigorous as
        possible, test them against the evidence, and scuttle them if they are no
        longer supported.
      </li>
      <li>
        Honor, respect, and distribute information. Thou shalt not die Tory,
        delay, or withhold information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use language with care and enrich it with systems concepts. Avoid language
        pollution; keep language as concrete, meaningful, and truthful as
        possible. Expand your language so we can talk about complexity. Eskimos
        have studied and learned how to use snow; the number of words Eskimos have
        for snow is in the double digits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable. Speak
        up about quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make feedback policies for feedback systems. The best policies not only
        contain feedback loops, but meta-feedback loops&mdash;loops that alter,
        correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design learning into
        the management process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go for the good of the whole. Don&rsquo;t maximize subsystems while
        ignoring the whole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Listen to the wisdom of the system. Before you charge in to make things
        better, pay attention to the value of what&rsquo;s already there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Locate responsibility in the system. Look for the ways the system creates
        its own behavior.&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        Stay humble&mdash;stay a learner. The thing to do, when you don&rsquo;t
        know, is not to bluff and not to freeze, but to learn. The way you learn
        is to experiment&mdash;by trial and error, error, error. Small steps,
        constantly monitoring, and a willingness to change course as you find out
        more about where it&rsquo;s leading. Error-embracing is the condition for
        learning.
      </li>
      <li>Celebrate complexity.</li>
      <li>
        Expand time horizons. You need to be watching both the shirt and the long
        term&mdash;the whole system.
      </li>
      <li>Defy the disciplines. Follow the voice of the system.</li>
      <li>Expand the boundary of caring.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        Don&rsquo;t erode the goal of goodness. Don&rsquo;t weigh the bad news
        more heavily than the good. Keep standards absolute.
      </li>
    </ul>
